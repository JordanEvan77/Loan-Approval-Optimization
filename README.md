# Loan-Approval-Optimization
Using a large Time Series data set from California to build a model that helps predict default on loans

The scenario is that you are a Loan Officer in 2010 out of San Jose, CA working at a local bank and have been given a very large dataset from the Small Business Association with a variety of features included. Your task is to create a model for predicting whether or not a loan given to a small business will be Charged Off or Paid in Full from new data coming in. Your specific industry you are analyzing is Real Estate and Rental and Leasing. There are 25 variables included in the initial version of the dataset.

Our main questions are:

1. what are 3 indicators or predictors of potential risk from the variables provided. Please review the variables provided and determine which variables would be valuable to predict the MIS_Status class. Provide a rationale for your decision as well as one quantitative method for confirming this. 

2. Identify any preprocessing and data cleaning that might need to be done to this data beforehand. You do not have a copy of the data so this is a projection of possible preprocessing or data cleaning that might be helpful. 

3. There are class imbalances, especially in the class we are trying to predict. Discuss the issues surrounding having class imbalances. Now discuss potential solutions to this class imbalance problem. 

4. At this point, the valuable features have been determined, the preprocessing and data cleaning completed and the class imbalances are handled. Now, we must choose a selection of 3 models to test and and get results from. Identify these three models and explain in detail the process of using them as well as a brief discussion of the mathematical theory of each model you chose. Explain why these models were chosen. Consider issues around overfitting and underfitting as well as any hyperparameters that might need to be tuned. You are not expected to have selected a perfect set of models and hyperparameters but rather to show critical thinking in your decisions. 

5. Finally, discuss the metrics that you would use for evaluation. Explain your rationale behind using those metrics.
